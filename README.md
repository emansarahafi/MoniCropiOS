# MoniCrop iOS

MoniCrop is a supplementary iOS application developed during the Mobile Programming 1 (COSC 348) class for a capstone project regarding developing a smart crop monitoring system that records information about the farm and crops, such as the soil's temperature, salinity & pH levels, etc. That is because the collected data can be viewed on an iOS device using this application alongside the original plan of displaying the data on a website.
